# Bay-Area-Bikeshare-Predictive-Analysis

This project uses data mining and predictive analytic techniques to explore the Bay Area bikeshare ridership data. 

The data is provided in several .csv's and the statistical analysis is done in R. 

The original data was too large to handle with one machine, so assumeing the average ride is more than five minutes the bike "status" data collection interval was reduced from 1 minute to 5 minutes. 

A number of predictive scenarios are explored, including ridership based on weather (does rain affect ridership?) and a market-basket experiment to uncover what routes might be connected to one another.
